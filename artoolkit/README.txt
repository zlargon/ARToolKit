About this archive.
-------------------
This archive contains the ARToolKit libraries, utilities and examples, version 2.71.2.

ARToolKit is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Please read the file COPYING.txt.

The latest version of ARToolKit is available from http://sf.net/projects/artoolkit.

ARToolKit is designed to build on Linux, Windows, Macintosh OS X, and SGI Irix platforms.

Building on Windows.
--------------------

Prerequisites:
 *  Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 or Visual Studio 6, or a free development environment such as Cygwin.
 *  DSVideoLib-0.0.8b-win32. Download from http://sf.net/projects/artoolkit.
 *  GLUT. Download from http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut/glut-3.7.6-bin.zip.
 *  (Optional, for VRML renderer only) OpenVRML-0.14.3-win32. Download from http://sf.net/projects/artoolkit.
 
Build steps:
(1) Unpack the ARToolKit zip to a convenient location. This location will be referred to below as {ARToolKit}.
(2) Unpack the DSVideoLib zip into {ARToolKit}. Make sure that the directory is named "DSVL".
(3) Copy the files DSVL.dll and DSVLd.dll from {ARToolKit}\DSVL\bin into {ARToolKit}\bin.
(4) Install GLUT, following the instructions in the README.win file inside the GLUT zip. See http://www.hitlabnz.org/forum/showpost.php?p=332&postcount=12 for more detail on how to install GLUT on Windows.
(5) Run the script {ARToolKit}\Configure.win32.bat to create include\AR\config.h.
(6) Open the ARToolKit.sln file (VS.NET) or ARToolkit.dsw file (VS6).
(7) Build the toolkit.

The VRML renderering library and example (libARvrml & simpleVRML) are optional builds:
(8) Unpack the OpenVRML zip into {ARToolKit}.
(9) Copy js32.dll from {ARToolKit}\OpenVRML\bin into {ARToolKit}\bin.
(10) Enable the libARvrml and simpleVRML projects in the VS configuration manager and build.


Building on Linux / SGI Irix.
-----------------------------

Prerequisites:
 *  (Optional, for VRML renderer only) openvrml-0.14.3 and dependencies. Download from http://sf.net/projects/openvrml.
 
Unpack the ARToolKit to a convenient location. The root of this location will be referred to below as {ARToolKit}:
    tar zxvf ARToolKit-2.71.2.tgz
Configure and build. The Linux builds support video input using either Video4Linux, an IIDC-compliant or DV camera connected via IEEE-1394, or a Sony EyeToy camera connected via USB. You will be prompted as to which of the four Linux video drivers you wish to use at the Configure step.
    cd {ARToolKit}
    ./Configure
	make
Following a successful build, to run a binary such as simpleTest:
	cd {ARToolKit}/bin
	./simpleTest

The VRML renderering library and example (libARvrml & simpleVRML) are optional builds:
	cd {ARToolKit}/lib/SRC/ARvrml
	make
	cd {ARToolKit}/examples/simpleVRML
	make
	cd {ARToolKit}/bin
	./simpleVRML


Building on Mac OS X.
---------------------------

Prerequisites:
 *  Apple's Developer Tools. http://developer.apple.com
 *  Camera driver. Mac OS X 10.3 and later include an inbuilt IIDC and DV FireWire camera driver. USB camera drivers, and Firewire camera drivers for pre-10.3 systems can be obtained from ioXperts at http://www.ioxperts.com.
 *  (Optional, for VRML renderer only) Apple X11 and Fink. Install X11 off the Mac OS X install CD 3 or download an install disk image from http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/apple/x11formacosx.html. Download Fink (and optionally, FinkCommander) from http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/.

Building using the XCode IDE:
(1) Unpack the archive to a convenient location using StuffIt Expander, and open the ARToolKit.xproj.
(2) Builds include a script target "Configure" which enables accelerated and rectangular texturing by default. If you wish to change these defaults, manually run the ./Configure script from Terminal as for a command-line build.
(3) Mac OS X XCode builds now build the examples as bundled applications. The contents of the "Data" directory are copied into the application bundle at build time. The applications can thus be moved from their build locations. The utilities are still (mostly) built as command-line tools.

The VRML renderering library and example (libARvrml & simpleVRML) are optional builds:
(4) Using FinkCommander, do a binary install of mozilla-dev, followed by an install of openvrml4-dev and openvrml-gl5-dev.
(5) Select the ARToolKit extensions target, and build.

Alternately, ARToolKit can be built from the Terminal, using the Unix makefiles.
Drop the ARToolKit into a convenient location, e.g. your Desktop, then open a Terminal window and type:
	cd ~/Desktop
	tar zxvf ARToolKit-2.71.2.tgz
Configure and build
	cd ~/ARToolKit
	./Configure
	make
Following a successful build, to run a binary such as simpleTest, add these commands:
	cd bin
	./simpleTest

The VRML renderering library and example (libARvrml & simpleVRML) are optional builds:
	fink -b install mozilla-dev
	fink install openvrml4-dev openvrml-gl5-dev
	cd ~/Desktop/ARToolKit/lib/SRC/ARvrml
	make
	cd ~/Desktop/ARToolKit/examples/simpleVRML
	make
	cd ~/Desktop/ARToolKit/bin
	./simpleVRML


Changes in this release (2005-10-11).
-------------------------------------
- Fixed line endings in MS Visual Studio 6 workspace (.dsw) file.


Changes in version 2.71.1 (2005-09-22).
---------------------------------------
- Mac OS X XCode builds: An outdated version of the project file slipped into the 2.71 release. This has been corrected.
- Mac OS X XCode builds: Version 2.1 of XCode is required. The obsolete XCode 2.0 .xcode project file has been removed. Users running on Mac OS X versions prior to 10.4 can still build using the command-line Makefiles.
- A bug in libARgsub_lite incorrectly restored OpenGL state. Fixed. Also corrected for this fix in simpleLite and twoView examples.
- Builds of calib_cparam now correctly link against libARgsub_lite.


Changes in version 2.71 (2005-09-21).
-------------------------------------
- Mac OS X video driver: QuickTime 6.4 is now required by default. (Support for  versions back to 4.0 can be enabled at compile-time if required). 
- Mac OS X libARgsub and binaries which call it: fix for bug "GLUT Warning: glutInit being called a second time" by moving glutInit to main so that it is called before calling arVideoOpen.
- Linux V4L video driver: Apply patch by Wayne Piekarski to auto-adjust video resolution.
- Windows video driver: Uses updated (0.0.8b) DSVideoLib. Building ARToolKit on Windows no longer requires installation of DirectX SDK, or registering of DS filters. It also includes many bug fixes.
- gsub_lite: Added complete support for runtime specification of pixel format and rectangle/power-of-2 textures.
- Mac OS X XCode builds now build the examples as bundled applications. The contents of the "Data" directory are copied into the application bundle at build time. The applications can thus be moved from their build locations. The utilities are still (mostly) built as command-line tools.
- The calibration utilties have been rewritten to use gsub_lite. They should now run much more reliably across different platforms.
